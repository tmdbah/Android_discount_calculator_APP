# Android_discount_calculator_APP
In this mini-project we will build our first Android application. We will get familiar with some common Android components. We will build a discount calculator application. 

### Part 1 (100 Points):

The interface should be created to match the user interface presented in Fig 1. You will
be using layout files, and strings.xml to create the user interface. To build the UI, please
follow the following tasks:

1. The string values used for all the labels used in this application and should not be
hardwired in the layout file.

2. Use the “Hint” attribute to set the “Enter Ticket Price” grayed out hint in the EditView
of the input field for the ticket price. The buttons are labeled as shown in Fig 1.

3. Clicking on a “XX% Discount” button:

a. If the ticket price is empty or is not a valid number you should show a Toast
message indicating that the number should be a valid positive number.

b. If the ticket price is entered correctly, the “Discount %” should be shown, and the
“Discounted Price” should be calculated and presented as shown in Fig 1(b). The
result should be formatted to 2 decimal places.

4. Clicking the “Clear” button should clear the form and bring it back to the initial state
shown in Fig 1(a).
